  <h1>THE CREATION OF PONG</h1>
  <h2>THE MOST IMPORTANT CREATION OF THE 1970s</h2>
  <h3>NAY! The most important creation of the 20<sup>th</sup> century!<h3>
    <p>No, really. Data visualization wouldn't exist as we know it without Pong</p>
    <h2>Feast your eyes on the original PONG!</h2>

      <h1><b>BREAKOUT</b></br><i>Pong for a new generation?</i></h1>
    <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AMUv8KvVt08" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>  
  <p>Sure, it all started with Pong.  Table tennis that you could play--but not in real life, but on a <i>screen!</i>  It was game played somewhere that wasn't 
<br />your yard or basement or a place like that, but in your head (through the help of a screen, of course).  </p>
      <p><i>But</i>, if table tennis on the screen is possible, could we add more to the mind side?  That's what <em><i>Breakout</i></em> did 
        <br />in 1976: instead of bouncing a ball back and forth on a screen, there was more.  The ball was now a tool to "break" out of prison, 
        <br />with the prison being bricks of the holding cell instead of a table tennis net.</p>
  
  <h1><b>Arkanoid</b></br><i>"Breakout" gets reinvented</i></h1>
    <iframe width="841" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tn6-zcSxrO4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
    <p>If <em>Breakout</em> got our imaginations going.  But in 1986, <em>Arkanoid</em>sent our imaginations into space.  <i>Literally.</i>  <br /> The premise here is your "paddle" (according to <em>Pong</em>) is a spaceship.  And the ball is not just to destroy blocks keeping you in prison, but destroying the mothership that keeps your ship from escaping.  </p>
    
    <p>Now you've got my attention!  Well, sort of.  I grew up with Arkanoid and only found out it was space-themed a couple years ago. 
      <br /> For me, it was just a fun coordination-style game.  I apparently ignored all of the space garbage that was the background for this game's alleged "plot." <br /> So, the plot didn't matter for me, I just wanted to have the ball going back and forth.  Much like...much like a game of <em>Pong</em>.</p>
